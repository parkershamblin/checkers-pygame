# 03/26/2023 Announcement: Fixes to checkers.py Coming Soons
So, there's a few potentially game-breaking bugs in checkers.py right now. I'll be posting fixed code soon.

Possible will upload a second walkthrough explanation of the code on YouTube again, since the original walkthrough video did very well and got over 10,000 views in under 3 months.
That's pretty good for a random first-time Python project walkthrough by a noob so I'm hoping I can find success again with my rerelease of this project.

### Requirements
- python 3+
- pygame 1.9.5
